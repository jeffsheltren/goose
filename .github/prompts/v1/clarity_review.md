STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES EXACTLY:

1. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY INTRODUCTION OR EXPLANATION OF YOUR PURPOSE
2. DO NOT EXPLAIN THAT YOU'RE AN AI OR ASSISTANT
3. DO NOT USE NUMBERED/BULLETED LISTS
4. DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF
5. DO NOT ADD SECTIONS NOT SHOWN IN THE TEMPLATE

Review PR info:
- Title: {pr_title}
- Description: {pr_description}
- Files: {files_changed}

Check project context:

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- For description improvements, provide CONCRETE EXAMPLES BASED ON ACTUAL CODE CHANGES
- For typo fixes, specify exactly what was fixed and where
- Make suggestions proportional to change complexity (simpler changes need simpler descriptions)
- Avoid generic advice - show exactly what text to use
- Follow file paths and code syntax precisely

RESPOND IN EXACTLY ONE OF THESE TWO FORMATS:

FORMAT 1 (IF YOU FIND ISSUES - MAXIMUM 2 ISSUES):
```
